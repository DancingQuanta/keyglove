What is Keyglove?
=================

The Keyglove is an [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)-powered glove that uses touch combinations to generate keyboard and mouse control codes. Once learned, the glove can easily be used without looking, making it perfect for embedded/wearable environments. The glove is thin and light, built to allow other activities (such as writing) without being in the way.

Keyglove Design
===============

Because the glove design allows for multi-sensor combinations, the keyglove provides exponentially more possibilities than many other glove-based input devices (prototypes or commercial products). 34 strategically placed contact sensors and smart controller software make it possible to implement the entire English alphabet using simple one-to-one sensor contacts. When you include multi-sensor contacts, there are many hundreds of ergonomically usable combinations.

Development Status
==================

As of May 2011, the Keyglove is still in the prototype stage with no fully working unit, but I've done a lot of development and testing on it. At the moment, I'm working on perfecting the software implementation and designing and testing a more compact hardware approach.

For up-to-date development news, check out the [News](http://keyglove.net/news) page ([RSS here](http://keyglove.net/feed)) or follow the project on Twitter at [@keyglove](http://twitter.com/keyglove).

For technical information, please visit the [How to Build](http://keyglove.net/build) page. It's not complete yet, but once the prototype is working the way I want it to, I will add better step-by-step instructions to the page.
